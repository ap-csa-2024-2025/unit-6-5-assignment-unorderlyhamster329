## Git Config
```
git config user.name "user"
git config user.email "email"
```

## Compiling and Running Java Programs
Note that since our classes are separate classes, you will need to compile ALL the files (at least one time).  You can do this by running
```
javac *.java
```
The star means to compile every file that is a Java file type.

Run your code by running
```
java Main.java
```

After you compile the shape classes, you only need to compile and run `Main.java` as usual.

# Instructions  

## Problem 1
Write a method named `reverse` that takes in an array of Strings as parameter, and prints each String in reverse (as in, the word itself is printed in reverse; you do NOT need to reverse the order of the array).  Use a for-each loop in your solution.

```
Enter array length:
4

Enter values:
hill
mold
tree
lake

Reversed:
llih
dlom
eert
ekal
```

## Problem 2
Write a method named `product` that takes in an array of integers as parameter, and returns the product of the elements of the array.  Use a for-each loop in your solution.

## Problem 3
Write a method named `average` that takes in an array of doubles as parameter, and returns the average of the elements of the array.  Use a for-each loop in your solution.
